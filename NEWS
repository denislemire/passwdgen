passwdGen NEWS
==============

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.2 -> 2.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Improved design of passwdGen classes.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.1 -> 2.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Intense overhaul of passwdGen. passwdGen's back-end is now a C++
    class which is installed as a shared library. The various
    interfaces (now distributed separately) use this class library to
    function.

  - The KDE and GNOME front-ends will now be included separately
    from passwdGen and also have independent version numbers. This is
    much easier to maintain and also allows passwdGen users to write
    their own front-ends should they find themselves with too much
    free time. This as I see it, is the best way to remain neutral in
    my choice of GUI toolkits and allows others freedom from my views
    as to development choices in passwdGen.

  - I stripped a lot of information from the AUTHORS file in the
    source distribution of passwdGen. While I greatly appreciate all
    the contributions that have been made, many of them are no longer
    relevant to the current code base. I didn't want to remove all
    mention to contributions so I left the names intact, just removed
    exactly what was contributed by each individual. If anyone who
    contributed to passwdGen has a problem with this, contact me.

  - Fixed a bug where if the user did -min=x or -max=x instead of the
    proper --min=x or --max=x passwdgen would segfault.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.02 -> 2.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - restructured passwdGen source tree, allowing complete isolation of
    passwdGen's engine and the various front-ends. This will allow any
    additional front-ends to be easily added in the future

  - passwdGen now uses minimum and maximum length instead of a fixed
    password length

  - very simple pronounceable password algorithm added

  - new KDE 2 front-end

  - Unfortunately, for security reasons passwdGen no longer supports
    system without /dev/urandom. Support for such systems is planned.
    Things would go a lot faster if somebody could contribute routines
    for a secure random number generator to passwdGen


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.01 -> 2.02
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - passwdGen should now build on FreeBSD and possibly many other
    non-Linux Unix systems. (compatibility reports appreciated)

  - Added feature to alternate characters to left and right keys

  - Fixed a bug where gpasswdgen would freeze if you tried to
    generate a password with no characters with left or right hand
    characters only. (shame on you if you tried to do this anyway)

  - It was suggested that I seed random from more then just one
    character for security reasons (improved randomness). This is now
    implemented as such.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 2.0 -> 2.01
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Slight improvements to GTK+ GUI (pixmaps on buttons, misc tweaks).

  - Slight code improvements to improve code modularity.

  - Package now uses GNU autoconf/automake for easier building and
    package maintainence.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.1 -> 2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Wrote first GTK+ version of passwdGen


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.02 -> 1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Rewrote getASCII() function, now much more efficient.

  - Wrote man page for passwdGen.

  - This version was never released publicly.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.01 -> 1.02
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Makefile compatibility improvements

  - passwdGen now prints warning to stderr if /dev/random can't be
    used.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.0 -> 1.01
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Fixed a minor bug, rewrote random seeding code.

  - First version publicly released.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 0.9 -> 1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Added option for left or right hand only passwords.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 0.8 -> 0.9
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Rewrote command line parsing code.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 0.7 -> 0.8
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Slight code clean-up, more efficient.

  - Increased max password length to 50 characters (was 25).

  - Improved command line syntax a little.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 0.6 -> 0.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Command line options fully implemented.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 0.5 -> 0.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Laid out foundation for command line handling


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 0.4 -> 0.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - /dev/random is now used on supported systems.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 0.3 -> 0.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Modularized the code and created Makefile


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 0.2 -> 0.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Another code clean-up (thanks Krypt) 


----------------------------------------------------------------------
 0.1 -> 0.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Code cleanup, more efficient
