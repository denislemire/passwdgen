passwdGen 2.2 README
====================

passwdGen is a utility for generating random passwords. The software is coded
entirely in C++ and has a rich set of features. It should prove useful for
system administrators or people who just like using cryptic passwords.

In systems where security is a concern, good secure passwords are often
necessary. In environments where password aging schemes are put in place it is
useful to have a quick way to come up with new unique passwords.

Amongst passwdGen's features is the ability to generate pronounceable passwords
(pronounceable passwords are easier to remember, yet still secure), and generate
passwords of entirely left, right, or alternating keys (useless).

passwdGen is also designed to be modular. The main codebase of passwdGen is a
C++ class library. As such it is trivial to write new front-ends for passwdGen
such as GUI interfaces for various desktop environments.

It is hoped that passwdGen is fairly portable across many Unix variants, I
believe it to be compatible with any Unix with /dev/random and GNU development
tools. Compatibility reports are greatly appreciated.

Unix's without /dev/random will be supported when an adequate way to gather
entropy is found on these systems.
